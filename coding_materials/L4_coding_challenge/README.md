# Can you help solve the bugs in our Pygame code?


## Bugs

1. Oh no! The pepper flies away! Can you find a bug in the code that is making that happen? The bug is somewhere in [Pepper.py](./Pepper.py).
2. Oh no! We can't move the Player! We need your help making the player move. Help us fix this by completing the `move` function in [Player.py](./Player.py).
3. Oh no! The pepper always goes to the center of the screen once the cat catches it! Help us find the code that causes this to happen! The bug is somewhere in [Game.py](./Game.py).

You do not need to change anything in my_functions.py to solve the bugs. Those are additional functions to help the game run.


## Tips

The bug instructions are also written in the top of each file. Solve the bugs in order because they become increasingly more difficult. The print function can be really helpful for debugging. Use it as a tool to help you understand the variables, when certain code runs, etc. Look at the existing code (without bugs) to get ideas for your solutions. Importantly, help each other, ask questions, and have fun!
